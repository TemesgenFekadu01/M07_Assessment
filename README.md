# Holiday Manager

## Intro
This is a holiday manager that allows a user to add and remove holidays to and from a list, and then export the list into a JSON file.
The holiday manager's functions and user interface exist in the Python file "HolidayManager.py". When running the Python script, the holiday
manager will start by loading an initial set of holidays that are included in the JSON file "holidays.json". It will then load in over two
thousand US holidays from the years 2020-2024. After the initial holidays have been pre-loaded, the user can navigate the main menu to add or
remove holidays, save changes into a JSON file, view holidays in a specified week, and exit the holiday manager.
