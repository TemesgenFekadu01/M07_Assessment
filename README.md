# Holiday Manager

This is a holiday manager that the user can use to add and remove holidays into a list, and then export the list into a json file.
The holiday manager interface and functions exist in the HolidayManager.py python file. When running the python file, the holiday
manager will start by loading an initial set of holidays included in the holidays.json JSON file. It will then load in about two
thousand US holidays form the year 2020-2024.
